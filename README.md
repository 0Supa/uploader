## License

### TL;DR

The AGPL 3.0 license requires anyone who modifies or distributes the software to make their source code available to end-users when the software is used over a network. It's like the GPL but with extra coverage for network usage.

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
